this is a recipe to make Cicchetti (it is a italian dish in venice)

Cicchetti , also sometimes spelled "cichetti" or called "cicheti" in Venetian language, are small snacks or side dishes, typically served in traditional "bàcari" (cicchetti bars or osterie) in Venice, Italy.

Cicchetti are cheap, costing on average a couple of euros — or dollars, for that matter — apiece (a bit more for more substantial seafood or meat cicchetti). Six to eight make a meal, affordable, too.
